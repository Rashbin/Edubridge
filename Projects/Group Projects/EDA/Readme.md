# Video Games Sales EDA

This is the group project that we have done on Video Game Sales EDA.
Our aim was to explore the data by all the possible ways and collect all the trends and patterns in the video game sales around the world.
For this we have used python visualization libraries which is by far the easiest way to communicate the story hidden in the dataset to the client.
